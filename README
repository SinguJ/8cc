This is my hobby project. As of April 2012, 8cc supports many C99 features
including preprocessor. Because 8cc can compile itself, the source code of the
compiler may be a good example what 8cc is able to handle.

8cc consists with two paths. In the first path, an AST is constructed for each
top level definition (function or variable definition), and the AST is then
transformed to an assembly text in the second path. The output can be run only
on Linux x86-64.
